## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING  
 
The objective of this data science project is to:
* analyze global population trends and understand their potential socioeconomic implications using a comprehensive dataset    
* provide insights into how population growth and distribution have evolved over time and how they correlate with different socioeconomic factors.     

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

* ``` Country Code ```: A unique code or identifier for each country or region.       
* ```Indicator Name```: The name of the indicator or measurement, which in this case is "Population, total."     
* ``` Indicator Code```: A code that identifies the specific  indicator, which is "SP.POP.TOTL" for total population.     
 
The columns from the metadata: 
  
* ```IncomeGroup```: The income group to which the country belongs, such as "High income" or "Low income." Similar to the 'Region' column, not all countries have this information (indicated by NaN).
